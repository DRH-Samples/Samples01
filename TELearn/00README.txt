These directories contain a sample of scripts and other files developed for an experimental project to use machine learning (Weka) combined with hidden Markov Models to integrate diverse data, including genomic data and the output of other programs, into improved TE predictions.

The Weka/ directory contains files for using Weka to make a base-by-base classification based on the evidence. 

The Learn/ directory contains files to smooth these base-by-base classifications into probabilistic predictions of TE location (start, stop) and type.
